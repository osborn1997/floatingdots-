# Hello World
 THis web application consist of Html Css and a couple java script functions.
 
 The Aim of this practice is to get a full page video background, and also to theme the rest of the website based on the video content and color
 
 ### here are a few functions youll find here
 
 The menu icon displays the contents which are naturally hidden by the right side of the page.
 
 Hovering over those items on the menu give a little dancing/floating animations that float on the dots.
 
 The icons on the front page also give this effect but on different annimation time and speed.
 
 The icons also target thier respective descriptions down in the body of the page onclick.
 
 There are a few social media links and a to the top button that takes you to the verry top of the page.
